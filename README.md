Finishing a great book is a bittersweet feeling; while it was a great experience, it is hard to part ways with the world the author created. This is why we decided to create this book recommendation engine. Sites such as Goodreads provide recommendations based off user similarities; if user A and user B both like similar books, then a book user B has read and enjoyed will be recommended to user A. However, we wanted to find similarities between books through actual writing style. By delving into Natural Language Processing (NLP), we explored excerpts by calculating aspects such as average syllable count, average word frequency, average sentence length, average word length, the Flesch-Kincaid score, and the Automated Readability Index (ARI). 
Using these statistics, we then used the SciKit-Learn library and K-means clustering to cluster together the books, using the elbow method to find the appropriate amount of clusters
We then developed a dashboard using plotly dash where the user can hover over points in the scatter graph and see which books were clustered together as well as choose a book from a dropdown and get the top 5 closest books in one tab. The other tab being some background information about the project to give the user some more understanding.
